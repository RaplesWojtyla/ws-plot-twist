The Hotel where he works will receive the arrival of the Forbest jury which is an evaluation organization that will evaluate whether the hotel deserves an extra star or not. Unfortunately, the hotel was told that the jury would come secretly and make an assessment for one week. This decision really upset Abang Gee as a Manager of the hotel. Then Johari along with his colleague, Sabri began to suspect that a family that came to stay at the hotel was the jury of The Forbest. This is because the character and gestures of Dato Wahab and Datin Mun’s family daughter, Neesa, are very suspicious and they don’t look like a real family. Meanwhile, Johari also tried to approach Neesa but failed. Finally, Johari had to use the method of disguising himself as a veiled woman named Johana just to get close and approach Neesa." ;

The perpetrators came face to face with their victims. They shot at men, women, children – day after day, obediently and assiduously, as if it were normal work. Tens of thousands of Germans belonged to the mobile commandos of the task forces and police battalions. Who were these men, how could they commit such murders? What did the few survivors tell, how were they able to escape the mass extinction and live on with the horrific experience? Based on written traditions, original documents, film footage and photos as well as expert statements, the documentary traces the path of one of these murder battalions." ;
